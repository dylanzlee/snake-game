# Snake Game Rules

Objective:
Make your snake as long as possible by eating food which spawns in the game

How to play:

- Use arrow keys to move your snake
- You will lose if your snake's head moves off the board or touches any other part of its body (this includes moving in the immediate opposite direction when your snake is at least two blocks long)

Additional Rules for Medium and Hard game modes:

- Your snake's speed will increase as it eats more food (Medium and Hard)
- Your snake will change into the color of the food it eats (Hard only)
- Obstacles in the form of white blocks will spawn, and the number of obstacles will increase the higher your score gets. You will lose if your snake touches a white block (Hard only)
